                that person joy.</p>

            <h1>Their lives depend on your donation</h1>
            <p class="people-howl">Following natural disasters like a hurricane or earthquake, many people rely on
                the generosity of
                strangers to help rebuild their lives. Donations to disaster relief organizations, local food and diaper
                banks, and other charities can make a big difference to people in great need.<br>
                However, we know that not everyone who can donate to these organizations ends up opening their wallets.
                In fact, a phenomenon known as compassion collapse (or fade) can make people less generous following
                catastrophic situationsâ€”or any time we are faced with many people in need.</p>
