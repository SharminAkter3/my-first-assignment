            <h1>Their lives depend on your donation</h1>
            <p class="people-howl">Following natural disasters like a hurricane or earthquake, many people rely on
                the generosity of strangers to help rebuild their lives.</p>
            <p class="people-howl">Donations to disaster relief organizations,
                local food and
                diaper banks, and other charities can make a big difference to people in great need.</p>

            <p class="people-howl"> we know that not everyone who can donate to these organizations ends up opening
                their wallets.</p>
            <p class="people-howl">In fact, a phenomenon known as compassion collapse (or fade) can make people less
                generous following catastrophic situationsâ€”or any time we are faced with many people in need.</p>

            <p class="about-suffering"> Actually, small donations can make a huge difference. The costs of
                meeting basic human needs in the developing world</p>
            <p class="about-suffering">are most often far less than the costs for those same
                services and supplies in the developed world.</p>
